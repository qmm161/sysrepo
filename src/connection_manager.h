/**
 * @defgroup cm Connection Manager
 * @{
 *
 * @brief Provides the communication between applications using sysrepo
 * (via @ref cl) and Sysrepo Engine. Acts as sysrepo connection server.
 *
 * It provides the event loop (started with ::cm_start), which handles all
 * connections and does message retrieval/delivery between @ref cl and
 * @ref rp. Messages are in the format of encoded (binary) Google
 * Protocol Buffer messages, which are always prepended with 4-byte preamble
 * containing message size.
 *
 * Connection Manager can work in two modes: daemon mode, or local mode.
 * The main distinction between the two is that the event loop is executed in
 * the main thread in daemon mode (making the main thread blocked until stop
 * is requested by ::cm_stop), whereas in local (library( mode the event loop
 * runs in a new dedicated thread (to not block caller thread).
